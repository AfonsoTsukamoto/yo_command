YO! From the terminal! 
==========

- A node.js script to send 'YOs' from the terminal using http://yo.moinnadeem.com/


For now. 
I'm waiting for a YO's API token, after that, I'll upgrade it to a HTTP post instead of websockets and use a config
for the tokens. 

If you still want to use it, `chmod` the file and `./poster.js <yo_name>` or `node poster.js <yo_name>`
